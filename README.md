### `formfilename.sh`

formfilename is a customizable filename formatter, to perform mass
character permutations on filenames. `fileformname` allows to: 
- **change the name of all the files** in a folder (non recursively) 
- **use bash ERE regular expressions**, including subgroup capturing
- **rename the files in place** (by deleting the old files and only keep the
  new ones)
- **copy or move the files to an other location**, expressed as a relative or
  absolute path

### `characters:md`

a list of special characters (mostly for eScriptorium)
